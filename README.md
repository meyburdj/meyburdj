# Hi there, I'm Jesse ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I am a fullstack software engineer. After working in k-12 education for ten years, I co-designed my first website--a test preperation platform--five years ago. My most recent website is [NewsroomToClassroom](https://newsroomtoclassroom.com). Newsroom to Classroom takes daily news articles and generates educational worksheets that teachers, parents, and students can download as pdfs or take online. The platform generates 60 publically accessible worksheets a day. It also allows users to generate their own worksheets by submitting the contents of a news article. Built on a Nextjs 13 App Directory frontend and a Flask backend the website has nearly 15,000 unique webpages, all optimized for SEO and user traffic.
